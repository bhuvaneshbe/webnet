&nbsp&nbsp&nbspImage processing is a method to convert an image into digital form and perform some operations on it, in
order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. Image processing has been proved to be effective tool for analysis in various fields and applications.
Agriculture is the backbone of human sustenance on this world. Now a days with growing population we need the
productivity of the agriculture to be increased a lot to meet the demands. In olden days they used natural methods to
increase the productivity, such as using the cow dung as a fertilizer in the fields. That resulted increase in the
productivity enough to meet the requirements of the population. But later people started thinking of earning more
profits by getting more outcome. So, there came a revolution called “Green Revolution”. After this period usage of
deadly poisons as herbicides has increased to a drastic level. By doing so we got success in increasing the
productivity but we have forgot damage done to the environment, which will arise a doubt in our sustenance on this
beautiful earth. This paper intends to focus on the survey of application of image processing in agriculture field such
as imaging techniques, weed detection and fruit grading, to reduce the usage of herbicides. The analysis of the
parameters has proved to be accurate and less time consuming as compared to traditional methods. Application of
image processing can improve decision making for vegetation measurement, irrigation, fruit sorting, etc.
